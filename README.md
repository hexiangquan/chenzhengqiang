-------------------------------------2015/8/7-----------------------------------------

this is my first try of using github,some of projects already uploaded.
Just clone it,if you are interested.
also there are some open-source projects written by others for my personal learning,
either scores of projects completed in company all by myself,
like flv streaming server based on http,hls server,speech transfer server and so on

so....

is there anything to say?

really nothing to say!!!

...how time goes fly.

recently I have completed the multi speech's mix in speech transfer server,which based on udp protocol,decode the opus audio data when there are more than one speaker into pcm meanwhile allocate a pcm buffer for each active speaker.when the buffer is full or timeout,just mix them and then broadcast them to all listeners; 

I am now writing the rtmp server named XtraRtmp,best wishes for me!


------------------------------------2016/1/22----------------------------------------

happy new year!

the XtraRtmp Project almost finished:85% finished;the interactions with rtmp stream pusher and player is already carried out;

But I must stop now for preparing for a new chance for my future's sake.Best wishes for me all the same!

I'm writing the file live server which update the live m3u8 file in real time through the m3u8 source,it takes me several hours

to implement the function,but there is a great challenge for keeping synchronization between player and the server

...and my own project "peonyMediaParser" was already carried out for parsing the mp4 media file,next step I'm determined to parse the mpeg-ts media format in peonyMediaParser project
