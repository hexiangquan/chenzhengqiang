Coding style/standards guidelines are important.  The standards that 
will be enforced are summarized as follows:

1. indent with 4 spaces (no tabs allowed)
2. Unix line endings
3. NO Hungarian notation
   
With exceptions noted above, standards for this project follow much 
of Linux kernel and Google guidelines:
